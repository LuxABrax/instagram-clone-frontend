## About

Code is a little bit messy but it works, looks almost identical and it's responsive.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm i`

To install dependencies and then:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
